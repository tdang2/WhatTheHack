# Challenge 00 - Overview

## Scenario

You are working with the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. They have several yearsâ€™ of data about taxi trips in New York City, but have no way to analyze it.

You will build a modern data estate to enable analytic and real-time data analysis and visualization. Your task is to use Azure data technologies to build this data estate, including:

* Ingesting and storing raw data
* Cleaning and enriching data
* Loading data into a serving layer
* Consuming data in a BI layer
* Orchestrating the overall data flow for repeatability

## Notes for OpenHack

The OpenHack is time-boxed to a few hours. Due to the short timeframe, the architecture to build is provided here for you, and the challenges will be specific and prescriptive regarding technologies and configurations.

## Architecture

## Challenge

* Prepare Resources
* Ingest and Store Source Data in Blob Storage
* Clean and Merge Data in Databricks
* Ingest cleaned/merged data from blob storage in Azure Data Warehouse using Polybase and Azure Data Factory
* Create Data model in Azure Analysis Services using SQL DW as source
* Consume Data in Power BI from Databricks and Azure Analysis Services
* Access a Weather API, store weather data in Cosmos DB, join to transaction data in Power BI

Some of the challenges can be worked on in parallel; others require preceding challenges to be completed. We suggest you read all the challenges before starting work and discuss/assign them as a team.

## Outcomes

An end-to-end solution spanning the data lifecycle, with functional Power BI dashboard(s).

## Resources and Artifacts

Challenge documentation is available during the event on the OpenHack Team. Documents, proctor guides, and code will be made available after the OpenHack.
